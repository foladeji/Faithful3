            <p id="img1d">This journey begain in the School of Art + Design where I put on a <strong>vision impairment apparatus </strong> that simulated <strong>complete blindness</strong>. In addition I was also equipped with a <strong>white cane</strong> to guide my way. <br><br>
            
            The objective in this was to simulate the experience of a potential vision impaired user. In this, the goal was to journey to the Gies College of Business unaided. <br><br>
            
            <em style="font-size: 13px">-<br>The only forms of guidiance were provided by collegues who supervised my journey and provided words of caution to steer me from any dangers.</em>

        <section id="b">
            <p id="img1d">The first of several activities of daily living I engaged in along was to <strong>drink from the water fountain</strong>. During this, I was <strong>heavily dependent on my hearing</strong> and, unavoidably, my mental model of a water fountain prior to being without sight.</p> </section>
        <section id="c">
            <p id="img1d">Aftewards, I began navigating my way through the first floor hallway and out of Art + Design. Prior to begining this, i underestimated how heavily I would <strong>depend on my hearing</strong>. <br><br> I listen to every sound, from the <strong>tapping of my cane</strong> to the <strong>footfalls</strong> ahead of me, all in an attempt to prevent from running into anything or anyone. I also found myself reflexively adopting <strong>a slow rhythmic gait</strong>. </p></section>
        <section id="d">
            <p id="img1d">Soon I arrived at the north exit in the link gallery. Here was my first major interaction with one of a multitude of architectural design decisions that affect users' experience. <br><br>
            
            In this, I attempted to <strong>find the ADA button</strong> to open the automatic doors; finding them proved <strong>fairly difficult</strong> but I eventually did. 
            
            </p></section>
        <section id="e">
            <p id="img1d">Upon finding and pushing the button, I was able to gain access out of the building.  </p></section>
        <section id="f">
            <p id="img1d">Once outside, to my surprise, it was actually a lot more <strong>difficult to maintain my orientation</strong>in the right direction. </section>
        <section id="g">
            <p id="img1d">Eventually, with the guidance of of my colleagues and adapting to this new condition, I soon fell into a fairly <strong>comfortable rhythm</strong>. </section>
        <section id="h">
            <p id="img1d">However, <strong>my reflexive anxiety</strong> did not subside entirely, and I occasionally had to pause during the journey to reassess and ensure I was indeed on the right path and out of danger. </p></section>
        <section id="i">
            <p id="img1d">Eventually, I was able to successfully enter Gies. </p></section>
        <section id="j">
            <p id="img1d">Within the building, there were several <strong>variable obstacles</strong> I had to navigate around, including people, equipment and several others. </p></section>
        <section id="k">
            <p id="img1d"> Eventually I reached the turning point at Gies, where I gave a reflection about the first half of the journey <em>(see below)</em>. <br><br>Afterwards, I switched impairment apparatus, put on a device to simulate partial vision loss, and began my journey back... </p></section>
